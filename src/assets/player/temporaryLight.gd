#Use of this script and code:
#This script is used as a temp light source 
#This will help others to see the spirit in the player scene 
#Also this is done as if there is no source in the scene for light the spirit will not be visible to the other contributors
func _ready():
	enabled = false#This code here switch off the enabled option of temp light so it doesn't  effect during game
