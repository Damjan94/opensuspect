# OpenSuspect

*One amongst us is not like the rest*

OpenSuspect is an open source online social deduction game, like mafia.

OpenSuspect aims to be easily modifiable.
It is built using the Godot engine.

This project is in *very early stage* development.
Interested to get involved? We'd love to hear from you.
